<h2 id="221-describe-the-function-of-the-eye">22.1 Describe the function of the eye.</h2>
<p>The <strong>eye</strong> is a highly specialized sensory organ responsible for <strong>vision</strong>, allowing humans to perceive light, shapes, colors, and depth. Its main function is to convert light into electrical signals that the brain can interpret, enabling us to see the world around us. Here's a breakdown of the <strong>functions of the eye</strong> and its key structures:</p>
<h3 id="1-cornea">1. <strong>Cornea</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>clear, dome-shaped outer layer</strong> at the front of the eye that helps focus light onto the retina.</li>
<li>It provides the majority of the eye’s refractive power, bending light as it enters the eye to help direct it toward the lens.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-pupil-and-iris">2. <strong>Pupil and Iris</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>pupil</strong> is the black circular opening in the center of the eye through which light enters.</li>
<li>The <strong>iris</strong> is the colored part of the eye that surrounds the pupil and controls the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil.<ul>
<li>In bright light, the pupil constricts (gets smaller) to reduce the amount of light entering.</li>
<li>In dim light, the pupil dilates (gets larger) to allow more light in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-lens">3. <strong>Lens</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Located just behind the iris and pupil, the <strong>lens</strong> further focuses light onto the retina.</li>
<li>The lens can <strong>change shape</strong> (becoming thicker or thinner) to adjust focus for objects at different distances—a process called <strong>accommodation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-retina">4. <strong>Retina</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>retina</strong> is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye that contains specialized cells called <strong>photoreceptors</strong> (rods and cones).<ul>
<li><strong>Rods</strong> are responsible for vision in low light and peripheral vision.</li>
<li><strong>Cones</strong> are responsible for color vision and seeing in bright light.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The retina converts incoming light into <strong>electrical signals</strong> that are sent to the brain for interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-optic-nerve">5. <strong>Optic Nerve</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>optic nerve</strong> is the nerve that transmits electrical signals from the retina to the brain.</li>
<li>It acts as the connection between the eye and the <strong>visual cortex</strong> of the brain, where the signals are processed into images.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-sclera">6. <strong>Sclera</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>sclera</strong> is the white, tough outer layer of the eye that provides structure and protection to the inner components of the eye.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-vitreous-humor">7. <strong>Vitreous Humor</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>vitreous humor</strong> is a clear, gel-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina. It helps the eye maintain its round shape and allows light to pass through to the retina.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-macula-and-fovea">8. <strong>Macula and Fovea</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>macula</strong> is a small, central area of the retina responsible for <strong>central vision</strong>, which allows us to see fine details.</li>
<li>The <strong>fovea</strong>, located in the center of the macula, is responsible for <strong>sharp, detailed vision</strong> and contains the highest concentration of cones.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-of-eye-function"><strong>Summary of Eye Function</strong>:</h3>
<p>The eye's primary function is to capture light and convert it into signals that the brain can interpret. Here's how it works in a simplified process:
1. <strong>Light enters</strong> the eye through the <strong>cornea</strong> and passes through the <strong>pupil</strong>.
2. The <strong>iris</strong> adjusts the pupil size based on the amount of light.
3. The <strong>lens</strong> further focuses the light onto the <strong>retina</strong>.
4. The <strong>retina</strong> converts light into electrical signals using <strong>photoreceptors</strong> (rods and cones).
5. The <strong>optic nerve</strong> transmits these signals to the brain, where the <strong>visual cortex</strong> processes them into images, allowing us to see.</p>
<p>The eye works like a camera, focusing light onto a receptive surface (the retina) and converting this light into a visual representation that the brain can understand.</p>
<h2 id="222-describe-the-assessment-and-management-of-ear-injuries">22.2 Describe the assessment and management of ear injuries.</h2>
<h3 id="assessment-and-management-of-ear-injuries"><strong>Assessment and Management of Ear Injuries</strong></h3>
<p>Ear injuries can vary in severity, ranging from minor external trauma to more serious internal injuries that may affect hearing and balance. Proper assessment and management are crucial to prevent complications and preserve ear function.</p>
<h3 id="1-assessment-of-ear-injuries"><strong>1. Assessment of Ear Injuries</strong></h3>
<h4 id="a-patient-history"><strong>a. Patient History</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask about the mechanism of injury</strong>: Determine how the injury occurred (e.g., blunt trauma, penetrating injury, loud noise exposure, or barotrauma from pressure changes).</li>
<li><strong>Gather symptoms</strong>: Ask the patient if they are experiencing pain, hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), dizziness, or discharge from the ear.</li>
<li><strong>Medical history</strong>: Inquire about pre-existing ear conditions (e.g., hearing loss, infections, or surgeries).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b-physical-examination"><strong>b. Physical Examination</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inspect the outer ear (pinna)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for visible signs of trauma (e.g., cuts, bruises, swelling, or deformities).</li>
<li>Check for signs of <strong>hematoma</strong> (e.g., auricular hematoma), which may need urgent drainage to prevent complications like cauliflower ear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examine the ear canal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an <strong>otoscope</strong> to look into the ear canal for any foreign objects, lacerations, swelling, or signs of infection.</li>
<li>Check for blood, pus, or <strong>clear fluid discharge</strong> (could indicate a ruptured eardrum or cerebrospinal fluid leakage in more severe cases).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the eardrum (tympanic membrane)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for signs of <strong>perforation</strong>, which may present as a visible hole or tear in the eardrum, or <strong>retracted</strong>/<strong>bulging membranes</strong>, indicating possible infection or trauma.</li>
<li><strong>Discharge</strong> from the ear may indicate a ruptured eardrum, especially if it is blood or fluid (which could indicate a basal skull fracture).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess hearing and balance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a basic <strong>hearing assessment</strong> (e.g., whisper test, finger rub) to check for any hearing loss.</li>
<li><strong>Ask about dizziness or vertigo</strong>, as inner ear injuries can affect the balance organs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Palpate for tenderness</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<p>Managing a patient with a <strong>penetrating injury to the eyeball</strong> requires extreme care to prevent further damage, preserve vision, and minimize the risk of infection. Eye injuries of this type are considered medical emergencies and need immediate attention. Here's how to <strong>manage</strong> a patient with a penetrating eye injury.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="steps-to-manage-a-penetrating-injury-to-the-eye"><strong>Steps to Manage a Penetrating Injury to the Eye:</strong></h3>
<h3 id="1-ensure-scene-safety">1. <strong>Ensure Scene Safety</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the scene is safe for both the patient and responders. Stabilize the environment to prevent further injury.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-do-not-remove-the-object">2. <strong>Do Not Remove the Object</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not attempt to remove</strong> the penetrating object from the eye. Removing it can cause further damage or severe bleeding.</li>
<li>The object may be applying pressure that prevents more severe internal damage or hemorrhaging, so it should remain in place until a specialist can safely remove it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-reassure-and-calm-the-patient">3. <strong>Reassure and Calm the Patient</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep the patient calm and as still as possible to avoid any movement that could worsen the injury.</li>
<li>Advise the patient to avoid <strong>moving their eye</strong>, blinking excessively, or rubbing the injured eye.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-cover-the-injured-eye-stabilization">4. <strong>Cover the Injured Eye (Stabilization)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to stabilize the object and <strong>protect the injured eye</strong> from further harm.</li>
<li><strong>Create a protective shield</strong>:<ul>
<li>If the object is protruding from the eye, stabilize it using a <strong>rigid shield</strong> or a <strong>cup</strong> (like a paper cup or eye shield).</li>
<li>The shield or cup should not touch the object but be placed over it to protect it from movement.</li>
<li>Secure the shield or cup with <strong>tape</strong> without applying pressure on the eye or the object itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid direct pressure</strong>: Do not apply pressure to the eye or surrounding areas to avoid increasing intraocular pressure or causing further injury.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-cover-the-uninjured-eye">5. <strong>Cover the Uninjured Eye</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Covering both eyes helps prevent <strong>movement of the injured eye</strong>. When one eye moves, the other moves as well, so covering the uninjured eye helps reduce involuntary eye movement.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>light dressing</strong> (such as a sterile pad or gauze) to gently cover the uninjured eye, securing it lightly with tape or a bandage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-position-the-patient">6. <strong>Position the Patient</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If possible, keep the patient in a <strong>semi-reclined</strong> or <strong>sitting position</strong> with the head elevated. This helps reduce intraocular pressure and minimizes the risk of further injury.</li>
<li>Advise the patient to keep their head still during transport.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-avoid-food-or-drink">7. <strong>Avoid Food or Drink</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not allow the patient to eat or drink anything, as they may require surgery, and anesthesia may be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-monitor-and-provide-reassurance">8. <strong>Monitor and Provide Reassurance</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Continuously monitor the patient's <strong>vital signs</strong> and provide emotional reassurance to keep them calm.</li>
<li>Keep the patient as still and relaxed as possible to prevent any additional trauma to the eye.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-transport-the-patient-to-emergency-care">9. <strong>Transport the Patient to Emergency Care</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activate emergency medical services (EMS)</strong> immediately. Penetrating eye injuries require urgent evaluation by an <strong>ophthalmologist</strong> or trauma specialist in an emergency room or trauma center.</li>
<li>Ensure the patient is transported carefully, with ongoing stabilization of the eye and the object.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-prevent-further-contamination-or-infection">10. <strong>Prevent Further Contamination or Infection</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid touching the injured eye or the object, as this can introduce bacteria and increase the risk of infection.</li>
<li>If possible, use <strong>sterile dressings</strong> to cover the shield or eye to help minimize contamination.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="demonstration-of-proper-management"><strong>Demonstration of Proper Management</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stabilize the Object</strong>:</li>
<li>
<p>For example, if a pencil is protruding from the eye, place a <strong>paper cup</strong> or rigid object over the pencil without pressing on it. Secure it with tape to avoid movement during transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover Both Eyes</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently cover the <strong>uninjured eye</strong> with a sterile pad or gauze. This prevents the patient from moving their injured eye involuntarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Position the Patient</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If conscious, keep the patient in a <strong>sitting or semi-reclined</strong> position, instructing them to stay as still as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure Transport</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>While waiting for emergency responders, continue to reassure the patient, check their <strong>vital signs</strong>, and be prepared to provide additional care if needed.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="dos-and-donts-in-penetrating-eye-injury-management"><strong>Do’s and Don’ts in Penetrating Eye Injury Management</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do</strong>:</li>
<li>Stabilize the object.</li>
<li>Cover both eyes to limit eye movement.</li>
<li>Keep the patient calm and still.</li>
<li>
<p>Transport the patient urgently to medical care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> remove the penetrating object.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> apply pressure directly to the injured eye.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> allow the patient to eat or drink.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong>:</h3>
<p>Proper management of a <strong>penetrating eye injury</strong> involves stabilizing the object, protecting both the injured and uninjured eye, keeping the patient calm, and transporting them for emergency medical treatment. These steps help prevent further injury and increase the chances of preserving vision.</p>
<h2 id="224-identify-the-important-structures-of-the-anterior-neck">22.4 Identify the important structures of the anterior neck.</h2>
<p>The <strong>anterior neck</strong> contains several important anatomical structures that are involved in breathing, swallowing, circulation, and nerve function. These structures include muscles, blood vessels, nerves, glands, and the airway. Here is a breakdown of the key <strong>structures of the anterior neck</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1-hyoid-bone">1. <strong>Hyoid Bone</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>hyoid bone</strong> is a small, U-shaped bone located at the base of the tongue, just above the larynx. It serves as an attachment site for muscles involved in swallowing and speech and is unique because it does not articulate with any other bones.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-thyroid-cartilage">2. <strong>Thyroid Cartilage</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>thyroid cartilage</strong> forms the <strong>Adam’s apple</strong> and is the largest cartilage of the larynx. It protects the vocal cords and the larynx.</li>
<li>The <strong>laryngeal prominence</strong> (commonly referred to as the Adam's apple) is more pronounced in males due to hormonal influences during puberty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-cricoid-cartilage">3. <strong>Cricoid Cartilage</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Located just below the thyroid cartilage, the <strong>cricoid cartilage</strong> forms a complete ring around the trachea. It is the only complete ring of cartilage in the airway and provides structural support to keep the airway open.</li>
<li>This is also a key landmark for performing procedures like <strong>cricothyroidotomy</strong> in emergency airway management.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-trachea-windpipe">4. <strong>Trachea (Windpipe)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>trachea</strong> is the airway that runs from the larynx down to the bronchi. It is a cartilaginous tube that carries air to and from the lungs.</li>
<li>The trachea is located centrally and is protected by a series of C-shaped cartilage rings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-thyroid-gland">5. <strong>Thyroid Gland</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>thyroid gland</strong> is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland located just below the cricoid cartilage, in front of the trachea. It consists of two lobes connected by a central <strong>isthmus</strong>.</li>
<li>The thyroid produces hormones (such as <strong>thyroxine (T4)</strong> and <strong>triiodothyronine (T3)</strong>) that regulate metabolism, growth, and development.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-parathyroid-glands">6. <strong>Parathyroid Glands</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>parathyroid glands</strong> are small, pea-sized glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. There are typically four parathyroid glands, and they secrete <strong>parathyroid hormone (PTH)</strong>, which helps regulate calcium levels in the blood.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-carotid-arteries">7. <strong>Carotid Arteries</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>common carotid arteries</strong> are located on each side of the neck and divide into the <strong>internal</strong> and <strong>external carotid arteries</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>Internal carotid artery</strong>: Supplies blood to the brain.</li>
<li><strong>External carotid artery</strong>: Supplies blood to the face and neck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>carotid pulse</strong> can be palpated by pressing lightly against the carotid artery on either side of the neck.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8-jugular-veins">8. <strong>Jugular Veins</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>internal jugular veins</strong> and <strong>external jugular veins</strong> drain deoxygenated blood from the brain, face, and neck and return it to the heart.<ul>
<li><strong>Internal jugular vein</strong>: Runs alongside the carotid artery and drains blood from the brain.</li>
<li><strong>External jugular vein</strong>: Located more superficially, it drains blood from the scalp and face.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-vagus-nerve-cranial-nerve-x">9. <strong>Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>vagus nerve</strong> runs along the neck within the carotid sheath and controls parasympathetic functions in the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. It also innervates structures of the larynx and pharynx, playing a role in voice, swallowing, and reflexes like coughing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-sternocleidomastoid-muscle">10. <strong>Sternocleidomastoid Muscle</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> is a large muscle that runs diagonally across the sides of the neck from the <strong>mastoid process</strong> (behind the ear) to the <strong>sternum</strong> and <strong>clavicle</strong>.</li>
<li>It is responsible for turning and flexing the head.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-anterior-jugular-vein">11. <strong>Anterior Jugular Vein</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>anterior jugular vein</strong> is located in the midline of the neck, more superficial than the internal and external jugular veins. It helps drain blood from the submental region (under the chin) and lower parts of the face.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-esophagus">12. <strong>Esophagus</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>esophagus</strong> is the muscular tube that lies behind the trachea and carries food and liquid from the throat to the stomach. It plays a key role in swallowing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-lymph-nodes">13. <strong>Lymph Nodes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The anterior neck contains numerous <strong>lymph nodes</strong>, which are part of the immune system. These nodes filter lymphatic fluid and can become enlarged or tender in response to infection or disease.<ul>
<li><strong>Cervical lymph nodes</strong> are found along the sides of the neck, near the carotid arteries and jugular veins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-of-key-structures-in-the-anterior-neck"><strong>Summary of Key Structures in the Anterior Neck</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hyoid Bone</strong>: Supports muscles involved in swallowing.</li>
<li><strong>Thyroid Cartilage</strong>: Forms the Adam's apple and protects the vocal cords.</li>
<li><strong>Cricoid Cartilage</strong>: Provides support to the airway.</li>
<li><strong>Trachea</strong>: Carries air to and from the lungs.</li>
<li><strong>Thyroid Gland</strong>: Regulates metabolism via hormone production.</li>

</li>
<li>Large <strong>hematomas</strong> can compress the airway or vascular structures, leading to difficulty breathing or swallowing.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="immediate-management-priorities"><strong>Immediate Management Priorities</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Airway Management</strong>:</li>
<li>Ensure the airway is open and clear. If the airway is compromised, use the <strong>jaw-thrust maneuver</strong> to open it while protecting the cervical spine.</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare for <strong>advanced airway management</strong> (e.g., endotracheal intubation or cricothyroidotomy) if the patient has a severely compromised airway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spinal Precautions</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume <strong>cervical spine injury</strong> in any trauma to the neck. <strong>Immobilize the spine</strong> immediately with a cervical collar and a long backboard if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Bleeding</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply <strong>direct pressure</strong> to control external bleeding. Avoid excessive pressure over penetrating injuries that involve major vessels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stabilize Penetrating Objects</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not remove penetrating objects</strong> from the neck. Instead, stabilize the object in place and ensure safe transport to the hospital for further evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor and Transport</strong>:</p>
</li>

<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</h3>
<p>Traumatic injuries to the neck and upper airway can quickly become life-threatening due to airway compromise, damage to major blood vessels, or spinal cord injury. Recognizing the <strong>signs and symptoms</strong> of these injuries is essential for timely and appropriate management, which includes securing the airway, controlling bleeding, stabilizing the cervical spine, and transporting the patient to a trauma facility.</p>
<h2 id="226-describe-the-function-of-the-lacrimal-glands">22.6 Describe the function of the lacrimal glands.</h2>
<p>The <strong>lacrimal glands</strong> are responsible for producing <strong>tears</strong>, which play an essential role in maintaining the health and function of the eyes. These glands are located in the upper outer region of each eye, just above the lateral aspect of the eye in the bony orbit.</p>
<h3 id="functions-of-the-lacrimal-glands"><strong>Functions of the Lacrimal Glands</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tear Production</strong>:</li>
<li>
<p>The primary function of the lacrimal glands is to produce <strong>tears</strong> (a watery fluid) that help keep the eyes <strong>moist</strong> and <strong>lubricated</strong>. This is crucial for comfort and clear vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection and Cleansing</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Tears contain <strong>enzymes</strong> (such as <strong>lysozyme</strong>) that help protect the eyes from infections by killing bacteria and other microorganisms.</li>
<li>
<p>Tears also <strong>wash away debris, dust</strong>, and irritants from the surface of the eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nourishment</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tears help nourish the <strong>cornea</strong>, the clear, front part of the eye, by delivering <strong>oxygen</strong> and <strong>nutrients</strong>. Since the cornea does not have its own blood supply, tears are essential for its health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintaining a Smooth Optical Surface</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A continuous film of tears spreads over the surface of the eye, creating a smooth surface that is critical for <strong>sharp vision</strong>. Without this, the light entering the eye would be scattered, leading to blurred vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emotional Tears</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>In addition to basal (continuous) tear production, the lacrimal glands are also involved in producing <strong>reflex tears</strong> (due to irritants like smoke or foreign objects) and <strong>emotional tears</strong> (triggered by feelings of sadness, joy, or other emotions).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tear-drainage"><strong>Tear Drainage</strong>:</h3>
<p>After the lacrimal glands produce tears, they are spread across the eye's surface when you blink. The tears are then drained through the <strong>lacrimal puncta</strong> (small openings in the inner corner of the eyelids), which lead to the <strong>nasolacrimal duct</strong>, where tears are carried into the nasal cavity. This is why your nose often runs when you cry.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary_1"><strong>Summary</strong>:</h3>
<p>The <strong>lacrimal glands</strong> produce tears to <strong>lubricate</strong>, <strong>protect</strong>, <strong>nourish</strong>, and maintain a smooth surface on the eyes, ensuring clear vision and preventing infections.</p>
<h2 id="227-describe-the-management-of-a-dental-injury">22.7 Describe the management of a dental injury.</h2>
<p>Management of a <strong>dental injury</strong> requires timely care to reduce pain, prevent infection, and preserve the injured tooth or teeth.
